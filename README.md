## Disclaimer

This repository has no other purpose but sharing.
I want to share my hackintosh configuration for this particular laptop with the whole world.
This is not a step by step guide, rather a thing that can greatly help you on your way of turning this or similar laptop into a hackintosh.
Though you can just grab and use this if you have same or very similar laptop model, I greatly encourage you not do so, but instead read all the things I will mention below and get some knowledge.

## Hmmm...

* Please create [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap) or `USBPort.kext` (Use Hackintool to do this) after install for best USB plug experience (uncheck SSDT-USBX-LAPTOP in config.plist or remove it when using USBMap/USBPort.kext)

* Create one-key cpufriend if you often use battery, power-plug always is not recommended for best performance
